#  Finger Counter using OpenCV

This project detects and counts fingers in real time using Python, OpenCV, and NumPy.  
It demonstrates computer vision techniques like background subtraction, contour detection, and convex hull analysis.  
Potential applications include gesture recognition, HCI (human-computer interaction), and robotics.

##  Features
- Background subtraction for hand region isolation  
- Hand segmentation with contours  
- Convex hull + geometry for finger counting  
- Real time webcam detection and overlay

### Hand Segmentation
The hand region is extracted from the webcam feed using background subtraction and contour detection.

### Convex Hull + Finger Detection
The convex hull highlights fingertips, and the system counts fingers in real time.
